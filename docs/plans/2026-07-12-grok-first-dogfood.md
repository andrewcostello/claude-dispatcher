# Grok-first dogfood + single-orchestrator restructure — Implementation Plan

> **Operator:** Grok Build (this session / future Grok sessions) *or* any
> supervising agent/human.  
> **Subject system:** `claude-dispatcher` dogfooding itself.  
> **Architectural rule:** The **dispatcher is the only orchestrator** for
> `dispatcher run`. Agents are **workers** (implement / design / verify /
> review). **No Tasker role under dispatch** — including when Claude is the
> implementer.  
> **Hard constraint (dogfood):** Once the Grok-only runtime lands, a full
> dogfood loop must run with **zero Claude CLI invocations** unless a task
> explicitly pins `agent: claude`.

**Goal:** (1) Restructure dispatched execution so orchestration lives only in
the dispatcher and every family (Claude, Grok, …) is a thin worker; (2) make
Grok a first-class implementer *and* operator so we dogfood the dispatcher
without Claude on the path; (3) progressively enhance quality, metering, and
UX.

**Architecture:**

```text
tasks.yaml + PRD/skeleton
        │
        ▼
┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
│           DISPATCHER (only loop)      │
│  worktree · [design?] · implement     │
│  mechanical gate · verifier · panel   │
│  cascade · PR/merge · journal         │
└───────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                │ spawn workers only
     design-agent   implementer   verifier   reviewers
     (optional)    (grok|claude|…)  (any)    (multi-family)
```

- **Claude remains first-class** as an *implementer* (and optional verifier /
  panel seat / cascade terminal). It does **not** re-run Tasker orchestration
  inside the spawn.
- **`tasker.md` stays** for **interactive** Claude Code / future Grok TUI
  sessions **without** the dispatcher (`/work-ticket`, standalone).

**Tech stack:** Python 3.11+ dispatcher, Grok CLI, optional Claude CLI, git
worktrees, pytest, `claude-workflow` roles as *worker* prompts.

**Non-goals:**
- Deleting Claude support or forcing all product repos to Grok-only.
- Porting full `tasker.md` prose into Python (stages + thin prompts only).
- Interactive Tasker replacement in Grok TUI (optional later track).
- Renaming the package (`claude-dispatcher` → …) — optional later.

---

## Why this restructure (even when Claude implements)

| Old path | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Dispatcher → Claude “adopt Tasker” → Tasker re-orchestrates | Two orchestrators, double panel risk, wasted tokens |
| Grok thin implementer / Claude thick Tasker | Unequal contracts; Grok unfairly compared |
| Quality owned partly by in-session Tasker | Non-deterministic; hard to journal |

**Rule:** If a job is “decide what happens next,” it belongs in the dispatcher.
If a job is “produce code / a design / a verdict,” it belongs in a worker spawn.

---

## Success criteria

### A. Single-orchestrator (all implementers)

1. `build_prompt(agent="claude")` does **not** instruct reading `tasker.md`.
2. Claude and Grok implementer prompts share the same job shape (implementer
   brief; optional design attached by dispatcher).
3. Preflight does **not** require Tasker role file unless interactive tooling
   is involved (dispatched runs: optional).
4. Existing suite green; Claude implementer path still works end-to-end.

### B. Grok-only dogfood

```bash
dispatcher run features/grok-dogfood/tasks.yaml \
  --mode unattended --no-claude --max-parallel 2
dispatcher status <run-id> --json
dispatcher report <run-id>
```

1. Zero `claude` process activity unless pinned.
2. Tasks Done or Blocked with real reasons.
3. ≥1 dogfood improvement lands via the loop.

---

## Current baseline (honest)

| Capability | State |
|------------|--------|
| Grok implementer prompt | Agent-native (no `tasker.md`) ✅ |
| Claude implementer prompt | **Still Tasker** ❌ |
| `effort` + quality cascade | Present; cascade terminal still Claude by default |
| Mechanical gate / panel / PR / journal | Dispatcher-owned ✅ |
| Design agent stage | **Missing** (was Tasker-only) ❌ |
| LLM verifier | Always Claude CLI |
| Preflight | Claude + Tasker-centric |
| Summary | Agent-written; synthetic for cross-family |

---

## Phase map

```
Phase 0   Operator loop + dogfood YAML scaffolding
Phase 1   ★ Single-orchestrator restructure (all agents)   ← core restructure
Phase 2   Grok-only runtime (--no-claude, preflight, usage)
Phase 3   Dogfood wave: improve dispatcher via dispatcher
Phase 4   Quality: per-task verify/panel levels + pluggable workers
Phase 5   Design stage (Critical/High/sometimes Medium) → levels + spec
Phase 6   Operator UX (watch, needs_attention)
Phase 7   Fleet defaults (routing as code) + policy refresh
Phase 8   claude-workflow dual-runtime docs/roles
```

Each phase has an **exit gate**. Do not start the next until green.

---

## Phase 0 — Operator loop + scaffolding

**Goal:** Supervise runs and hold dogfood task definitions.

### Task 0.1 — Operator runbook

**Files:** Create `docs/dogfood/GROK_OPERATOR.md`

**Contents:** prerequisites, install, start/status/resume/report, Claude-leak
detection (`pgrep`, journal `agent`), triage, pointer to single-orchestrator
rule (“dispatcher is Tasker; workers only implement”).

**Exit gate:** Grok or human can dry-run without inventing flags.

### Task 0.2 — Dogfood feature skeleton

**Files:**
- Create: `features/grok-dogfood/tasks.yaml`
- Create: `features/grok-dogfood/PRD.md`

**Initial rows (XS/S, `agent: grok`):**
- `DOG-0-1` — `docs/dogfood/README.md` → runbook
- `DOG-0-2` — pytest: **both** `agent=grok` and `agent=claude` prompts omit
  `tasker.md` (locks restructure invariant; may fail until Phase 1)

**Exit gate:** `dispatcher run … --mode dry-run` plans successfully.

---

## Phase 1 — Single-orchestrator restructure ★

**Goal:** Under `dispatcher run`, **no agent adopts Tasker**. Claude is an
implementer worker like Grok. Missing Tasker *orchestration* is either already
in the dispatcher or deferred to explicit stages (Phase 5 design).

### Task 1.1 — Unified implementer prompt for all families

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/claude_dispatcher/spawn.py` (`build_prompt`, remove
  Claude→Tasker branch)
- Prefer load from workflow file if present:
  `.claude/workflow/roles/implementer.md` (or `coder.md` with a thin wrapper)
- Fallback: embed `IMPLEMENTER_PROMPT` (today’s cross-family brief), including
  Claude
- Test: `tests/test_implementer_prompts_effort_panel.py` — assert **no**
  `tasker.md` for claude/grok/codex/gemini
- Test: update any test that expected Tasker wording for Claude

**Behavior:**
- Same job: implement task in CWD, tests if feasible, summary path, no PR/push.
- Optional prefix blocks injected by dispatcher only:
  - prior cascade failure context (exists)
  - approved design spec (Phase 5)
  - panel/verifier fix lists (exists on iterate)

**Exit gate:** Unit tests green; Claude spawn prompt has no Tasker adoption.

### Task 1.2 — Dispatcher owns summary contract

**Files:**
- Modify: `spawn.py` synthetic summary + orchestrator Done path
- Modify: `summary.py` if needed
- Docs: note in runbook

**Behavior:**
- Prefer agent-written summary when present and parseable.
- If missing/malformed but commits + mechanical gate green: dispatcher writes a
  **canonical** summary from journal facts (status, files from diff, gate
  outcome) — not only cross-family.
- Agents never write tasks YAML.

**Exit gate:** Deliberate “no summary file” Grok/Claude implementer still can
reach Done when gate green (or Blocked with clear reason).

### Task 1.3 — Preflight: Tasker file not required for dispatch

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/claude_dispatcher/preflight.py`
- Test: `tests/test_preflight.py`

**Behavior:**
- Tasker role file check: **warning** or skip for dispatched runs (implementer
  prompt is self-contained / implementer.md).
- Claude permission flags: only if any cascade rung uses Claude.
- Keep git / dispatcher install checks.

**Exit gate:** Preflight PASS without `.claude/workflow/roles/tasker.md` when
using implementer-only prompts.

### Task 1.4 — Kill dual-orchestration docs in-repo

**Files:**
- Modify: `README.md` (dispatcher) — dispatched agents are implementers
- Modify: `Claude.md` / experiment notes if they imply Tasker-under-dispatch
- Create: `docs/architecture/single-orchestrator.md` (1–2 pages: diagram + rules)

**Exit gate:** New contributor reads one doc and understands Tasker ≠ dispatch.

### Task 1.5 — Regression smoke (Claude implementer, no Tasker)

**Manual / scripted:**
```bash
dispatcher run features/grok-dogfood/tasks.yaml \
  --only DOG-0-2 --implementer claude --mode unattended \
  --claude-extra-args '…permissions…'
```
(or a hermetic fake_claude test that asserts prompt content)

**Exit gate:** Claude implementer completes a tiny task without Tasker phases;
mechanical gate still enforces quality.

### Phase 1 exit gate (all of)

- [ ] No `tasker.md` in any implementer prompt
- [ ] Claude + Grok share implementer job shape
- [ ] Full pytest suite green
- [ ] Architecture doc landed

---

## Phase 2 — Grok-only runtime

**Goal:** Complete runs with Claude off PATH (dogfood honesty).

### Task 2.1 — `--no-claude` / cascade terminal config

**Files:** `repo_config.py`, `cli.py`, `orchestrator.py` `RunConfig`,
`.dispatcher.yaml`, tests

```yaml
implementer: grok
cascade:
  terminal: grok    # dogfood; production may use claude
```

`--no-claude`:
- default implementer grok if unset
- `cascade.terminal = grok`
- force `haiku_summary=False`
- verifier: skip or non-Claude (Phase 4)
- preflight: do not require Claude binary

### Task 2.2 — Cascade never appends Claude when terminal=grok

**Files:** `orchestrator.py` `_implementer_cascade`, `tests/test_agent_fallback.py`

### Task 2.3 — Doctor/preflight Grok binary + version capture

**Files:** `doctor.py`, `preflight.py`, `spawn.capture_agent_version` per family

### Task 2.4 — Grok usage parse (`--output-format json`)

**Files:** `spawn.py`, `tests/test_spawn_usage.py`, fixture from one real capture

### Task 2.5 — Hermetic `fake_grok` for CI

**Files:** `tests/fixtures/fake_grok.py`, wire into no-Claude integration tests

### Task 2.6 — Manual PATH-sans-claude smoke

**Exit gate:** Unattended dogfood smoke Done with no `claude` binary.

---

## Phase 3 — Dogfood wave (dispatcher improves itself)

**Goal:** ≥3 real improvements via `dispatcher run --no-claude`.

### Task 3.1 — Expand `features/grok-dogfood/tasks.yaml`

Contract-first S/M tasks, e.g.:
- finish any Phase 2 gaps not hand-landed
- report cheatsheet for grok implementer
- cascade/unit locks
- docs polish

Rules: `agent: grok`, no HARD labels until Phase 4 panel is Claude-free;
tests as acceptance.

### Task 3.2 — Operator loop protocol (in runbook)

plan YAML → run → status/watch → fix/resume → review diffs → pytest → next

### Task 3.3 — Integration: feature branch `dogfood/grok-first`

Not main until suite green.

**Exit gate:** ≥3 tasks landed through dispatch; human/Grok merges feature branch.

---

## Phase 4 — Quality workers + per-task intensity

**Goal:** Verifier + panel as pluggable **workers**; intensity is a
**first-class task field** that overrides run defaults. Still no second
orchestrator.

### Why per-task levels

Run-level flags (`--cross-family-panel auto|always|never`,
`--skip-verification`) are too coarse:

- An XS leaf and an M auth task in the same run need different scrutiny.
- Planners (and Phase 5 design) can **name** the right intensity up front.
- Dogfood / `--no-claude` can keep cheap defaults while Critical tasks still
  request a real panel when seats are available.

### Intensity model (resolved at dispatch)

**Verifier levels** (`verify:` on task, or run default):

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `none` | Skip LLM verifier (mechanical gate still runs unless skipped elsewhere) |
| `mechanical` | Mechanical only; journal `verification_skipped: mechanical_only` |
| `llm` | One LLM verifier pass (default family from config: claude\|grok) |
| `llm_strict` | LLM verifier + stricter incomplete handling (lower bar for INCOMPLETE / more iterations) |

**Panel levels** (`panel:` on task, or run default / auto policy):

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `never` | No cross-family panel |
| `auto` | Existing risk/size policy (`panel_required` + leaf skip) |
| `single` | One available non-author family (cheap second look) |
| `full` | Full authoritative panel (available seats; exclude author) |
| `always` | Force full even for small leaves (opt-in expensive) |

**Resolution order (highest wins for a single task):**

```text
1. Explicit task field:   verify: / panel:
2. Design recommendation  (Phase 5 — written onto the row or run artifact)
3. Deterministic defaults from labels/size/risk (routing table)
4. Run-level CLI / .dispatcher.yaml defaults
```

Explicit task fields always win over design and defaults (human/planner intent).

### Task 4.1 — Schema + resolution

**Files:** `plan.py` (`Task.verify`, `Task.panel`), `orchestrator.py`
`TaskSnapshot`, `RunConfig` defaults, tests

```yaml
tasks:
  - key: LEAF-1
    labels: [size:XS]
    verify: mechanical      # override: no LLM verifier
    panel: never
    agent: grok

  - key: AUTH-1
    labels: [size:M, security]
    verify: llm_strict
    panel: full
    agent: claude
```

Validate enums; unknown → `ValidationError`.

### Task 4.2 — Pluggable verifier worker

- Config: `verifier_agent: claude|grok` (who runs `llm` / `llm_strict`)
- `--no-claude` ⇒ default verifier_agent `grok` if present else treat `llm*` as
  `mechanical` + warning
- Honor per-task `verify:` level in `_verify_llm_and_maybe_iterate` path

### Task 4.3 — Panel seats without requiring Claude

- Build panel from available families; under no-Claude drop Claude seat
- Honor per-task `panel:` (`never`/`single`/`full`/`always`/`auto`)
- Keep corroboration consensus for multi-seat panels

### Task 4.4 — Done requires evidence

Auto-commit OK; Done requires mechanical green when a test command exists
(else cascade/Block). Independent of verify/panel levels.

**Exit gate:**
- Unit tests for resolution order and enum validation
- Two tasks in one run with different `verify`/`panel` levels behave differently
- Risk task can `panel: full` without Claude binary when grok/codex/gemini exist

---

## Phase 5 — Design stage (Critical / High / sometimes Medium)

**Goal:** Dispatcher-owned design **before** implement, for tasks that need
architecture judgment — and design **recommends** verify/panel intensity when
the task did not pin them.

### When design runs

| Trigger | Design? |
|---------|---------|
| `design: true` / `design: false` on task | Honor explicit |
| Labels critical / security / financial / high (risk) | **Yes** (unless `design: false` or `SKIP_DESIGN`) |
| `size:L` / `size:XL` | **Yes** |
| `size:M` + (foundation: ≥2 dependents, or label `design`, or `area:core` / novel-contract language in description) | **Sometimes — yes** |
| `size:XS` / `S` leaf, no risk | **No** (default) |

Deterministic rules live in dispatcher code (not the design agent). Journal
`design_skipped` with reason when skipped.

### Design outputs (structured, machine-usable)

Worker uses design-agent role; must emit (or dispatcher extracts):

```markdown
## Designs
### Design A …
### Design B …

## Recommendation
- selected: A   # or left for human in supervised mode
- verify: llm_strict | llm | mechanical | none
- panel: full | single | auto | never
- rationale: one paragraph
```

**Rules for applying recommendations:**

1. If task already has `verify:` / `panel:`, **do not overwrite** (task wins).
2. Else write recommended levels onto the in-memory snapshot for this run
   (and optionally stamp the YAML row for audit: `verify_recommended` /
   `panel_recommended` vs applied `verify`/`panel`).
3. Never *lower* intensity below the deterministic floor for the risk tier
   without an explicit task field. Example: Critical risk floor is at least
   `verify: llm` + `panel: full` even if design says `never`.
4. Supervised mode: human can pick design + override levels before implement.

### Task 5.1 — Design stage in orchestrator

**When:** triggers above and not skipped.

**Flow:**
1. Spawn design worker (config `design_agent: claude|grok|…`).
2. Parse designs + recommendation block.
3. Select design (supervised human / unattended first+heuristic).
4. Resolve verify/panel via Phase 4 resolution order (incl. design recs).
5. Attach `### Approved Design Spec` to implementer prompt.
6. Journal `run_dir/<key>/design.md` + events `design_started` /
   `design_selected` / `quality_levels_resolved`.

### Task 5.2 — Medium “sometimes” heuristics (unit-tested)

Pure function e.g. `design_required(task) -> bool` covering critical/high/L/XL
and medium rules; no network.

### Task 5.3 — Floors table (config)

```yaml
quality_floors:
  critical: { verify: llm_strict, panel: full }
  high:     { verify: llm,        panel: full }
  medium:   { verify: llm,        panel: auto }
  low:      { verify: mechanical, panel: never }
```

Design may raise above floor; may not sink below without explicit task override.

**Exit gate:**
- Critical fixture: design.md exists, implementer prompt has approved spec,
  resolved levels ≥ floor
- Medium-with-`design: true`: design runs; recommends levels applied when unset
- Medium leaf with no flags: design skipped; cheap defaults
- Task with `verify: mechanical` on Critical still honors task override
  (documented escape hatch; journal `below_floor_override`)

---

## Phase 6 — Operator UX

### Task 6.1 — `dispatcher watch <run-id>`

Tail journal; compact events; exit non-zero on Blocked when run ends.

### Task 6.2 — `status --json` → `needs_attention[]`

### Task 6.3 — Document ntfy/Slack for Blocked-only

**Exit gate:** Operator loop uses watch + needs_attention only.

---

## Phase 7 — Fleet defaults

### Task 7.1 — `routing.py` from `docs/agent-routing-policy.md`

EASY/MEDIUM → grok cascade; HARD → claude if available else grok@high + flag.

### Task 7.2 — Refresh routing policy from dogfood evidence

### Task 7.3 — `.dispatcher.yaml` production-shaped defaults

```yaml
implementer: grok          # volume
cascade:
  terminal: claude         # quality closer when Claude installed
# dogfood: --no-claude forces terminal grok
```

**Exit gate:** Defaults documented; dogfood override still one flag.

---

## Phase 8 — claude-workflow dual-runtime

**Upstream:** `~/Project/claude-workflow` (submodule consumers).

### Task 8.1 — Add `roles/implementer.md`

Canonical worker brief; dispatcher loads it when present.

### Task 8.2 — `tasker.md` header: “Interactive only — not used under dispatcher”

### Task 8.3 — `prd-to-task-yaml` / `task-yaml-review`: `agent` + `effort` + routing

### Task 8.4 — README: Dispatched mode vs Interactive mode

**Exit gate:** Workflow README matches single-orchestrator architecture.

---

## What we explicitly will *not* put back into agents

- In-session multi-agent dispatch (Task tool as orchestrator)
- In-session cross-family panel (dispatcher panel only under dispatch)
- PR create / merge / worktree lifecycle
- Runnable-set / blockedBy planning mid-implementer

Those stay dispatcher (or pre-dispatch Planner → YAML).

---

## Testing strategy

| Layer | What |
|-------|------|
| Unit | Prompt invariants (all agents), cascade terminal, preflight, usage parse |
| Hermetic | `fake_claude` + `fake_grok` implementer-only prompts |
| Integration | no-Claude PATH smoke; Claude implementer without Tasker |
| Dogfood | Real Grok on feature branch |

---

## Risk register

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Claude quality drops without Tasker ceremony | Mechanical gate + verifier + panel already own quality; design stage for Critical |
| Missing design on hard tasks | Phase 5; until then pin human PRD/skeleton in description |
| Scope creep rewriting all of tasker.md | Only implementer prompt + optional design stage |
| Claude users surprised | Docs + Claude still default cascade terminal in prod config |
| Dogfood fights WIP | Branch `dogfood/grok-first` |

---

## Execution protocol

1. **Phase 1 first (or in parallel with 0)** — restructure unlocks fair Grok *and*
   cleaner Claude; do this even if Claude remains the human’s interactive tool.
2. **Phase 2** — unlock honest Grok-only dogfood.
3. **Phase 3+** — prefer implementing via dispatcher, not hand-editing main.
4. **Chicken-and-egg:** Phase 0–2 may be interactive Grok/human; Phase 3+
   dispatched.

### Suggested sessions

```
Session A — Phase 0 + Phase 1 (restructure) + Phase 2 bootstrap
  Interactive Grok/human, TDD, branch dogfood/grok-first

Session B — Phase 3 dogfood loop
  dispatcher run --no-claude; watch; merge task branches

Session C — Phase 4–5 quality + design stage
  Still dogfood where possible
```

---

## Progress checklist

- [x] Phase 0: runbook + dogfood YAML
- [x] Phase 1: ★ no Tasker under dispatch; unified implementer; docs
- [x] Phase 2: --no-claude / cascade-terminal / preflight / grok usage parse / fake_grok
- [x] **Unattended smoke with real Grok** — `dogfood-smoke-20260713T061016Z` Done; see `docs/dogfood/SMOKE_RESULTS.md`
- [x] Phase 3: dogfood tasks expanded (DOG-0/2/4); operator runbook updated (live dogfood loop still operator-driven)
- [x] Phase 4: per-task `verify`/`panel` + `quality_levels` + **Grok LLM verifier** (`--verifier-agent`) + panel without Claude under `--no-claude`
- [x] Phase 5: `design_required()` + **design stage** (`--enable-design-stage`, parse Recommendation → levels)
- [x] Phase 6: `dispatcher watch` + status JSON **`needs_attention`**
- [x] Phase 7: `routing.py` + `--cheap-first` / `--no-claude` routing defaults
- [x] Phase 8: `claude-workflow` dual-runtime (`implementer.md`, Tasker interactive-only notes)

---

## Open decisions (defaults)

| Decision | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Panel in early dogfood | task `panel: never` / run default until Phase 4 |
| Cascade terminal (dogfood) | `grok` via `--no-claude` |
| Cascade terminal (prod config) | `claude` when installed |
| Verifier under no-Claude | default `mechanical`; per-task may request `llm` via grok |
| Design stage agent | claude if present else grok |
| Design may lower intensity? | No — only raise above floor unless task explicitly overrides |
| Integration | feature branch `dogfood/grok-first` |

---

## Handoff

**Plan updated:** `docs/plans/2026-07-12-grok-first-dogfood.md`

**Includes:**
1. **Single-orchestrator restructure** (Phase 1) — applies even when Claude
   implements.
2. **Grok-first dogfood** (Phases 2–3+) — no Claude on the path when
   `--no-claude`.
3. **Claude remains** implementer / cascade terminal / panel seat outside
   no-Claude mode.
4. **Tasker** reserved for interactive non-dispatch sessions only.

**Ready to execute Phase 0 + Phase 1** in this session when you say go.
